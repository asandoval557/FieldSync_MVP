#FieldSync
A native Android retail execution platform that streamlines field account manager workflows during client store visits.

#Introduction
FieldSync solves the critical inefficiency problem facing field account managers who spend excessive time on administrative tasks instead of building client relationships. Current solutions force users to switch between 3-4 different applications per store visit, manually enter duplicate data, and lack real-time access to sales performance metrics.

#Why FieldSync?
â€¢	Consolidates GPS check-in/check-out, merchandising compliance tracking, CRM functionality, and sales data visualization into a single, intuitive native Android experience
â€¢	Targets mid-market companies (50-1000 employees) who need more functionality than basic tools but cannot justify enterprise-level complexity and pricing
â€¢	Replaces fragmented manual processes with an integrated digital solution

#Features
